Dear reader, you should know that this story is an incomplete one. One that writes itself rather than being written. One that is shaped on the current events of the reader. More so a passage than a story in fact. A passage of description. A passage of love. A passage of two. The passage begins when a man named Haider is scrolling aimlessly on his phone one night, bored with nothing to do, no one to socialise with, until he remembers that socialisation doesn’t even have to be done face to face anymore. Parallel to him, with the same idea, a girl by the name of Sheza. What they didn’t know is that this would be a turning point in both of their lives, a fateful night that would shape the future to become everything they had both dreamed of. The two passed by many freaks on the app, all kinds of them. Finally though, they came across each other. He spoke first without any knowledge of who he was even talking to, staring at a black screen. She was shy, hesitant but in a way that made her voice soft and soothing. She saw someone who she felt as though she might actually be able to have a normal conversation with and he found someone who seemed like they needed protection, love, and someone who actually gave him attention. In a way she’d come across another freak as he started singing to her, melodious yes, but weird also yes. She did get the ick however chose to look past it and stay and eventually they exchanged socials. Something that wasn’t supposed to happen, that almost never happened, yet it would blossom into a love eternal and beautiful. This was destiny, fate and answered duas.

Over the next few weeks, they’d get to know each other better than expected. The conversations were full and never dying. They clicked perfectly. Haider discovered Shezas love for many things: teddies, chocolate, Chinese food, chocolate, shopping, clothes, handbags, makeup, chocolate, hijabs, jewellery and even chocolate. As they spoke they discovered their passion for movies, tv shows and other forms of entertainment. The two absolutely loved marvel and all Haider could think about was the possibility of the two them cuddled together and watching them in the future. Stepping off point slightly, Haider realised he still didn’t have a good idea of what Sheza looked like so he asked her to show him, and so she did. There were pictures of her in a blue outfit, at a wedding, and one with her little sister kissing her on the cheek. He was mesmerised, breathless at the sight of such beauty. Getting back on track, the two loved entertainment and so Haider wished to delve further and it was then that he discovered Sheza loved rom coms. It was convenient as he’d watched his fair share as well as having many saved in a watch later list. Seeing his opportunity he pounced at a thought in his mind, asking Sheza if she’d like to watch a movie on call to which she agreed. He was ecstatic. He’d be watching a rom com with his crush and bonding with her, he’d always had the thought of watching a movie with a girl, she wasn’t his girl yet but that’s was the hope, a hope he held on to tightly. And so they watched ‘how to lose a guy in 10 days’. He hated it. But not to worry because shortly after, on a nerve wracking day, Haider saw another opportunity that Sheza was constantly hinting towards her bf at the time not having asked her to be his valentines and so Haider thought to himself, ‘Why don’t I?’ He was in a frenzy of panic and nerves, at the fear of rejection. However, with all the desire he had for this girl he asked for her to be his valentines, to which she gave confirmation. The two were close to happier than they’d possibly ever been before, jumping with joy inside that their crush on each other was finally progressing after a whole two weeks of taking. Although she was his valentines, Haider didn’t just want for the two of them to do the usual text all day. He wanted to plan a date, and so he seized the opportunity to once again ask to watch a movie together. The night came and everything was perfect, the snacks, the mood, the movie, it was all wonderful and everything he had hoped for it to be. He wanted to tell her right there that he liked her but he’d been rejected so many times he was too afraid to ask, but that’s when Sheza, in all her fright and anxiousness asked first. He couldn’t believe it. Someone genuinely liked him back, wanted to be with him. It was the blooming of a love that he hoped would last forever.

In the upcoming year of their relationship they would:
Learn about each other
Grow together
Understand each other
Be each others rock in hard times
Love each other
Raise guppy the fish as their own
Buy each other gifts
Talk everyday
He’d compliment her and be her hype man when she got ready
Forgive each other
Make memories of silly faces and things they’d say to each other

In Haider’s eyes, Sheza was the most perfect, beautiful, amazing, respectful, adorable, lovable, compassionate, patient and just the best girlfriend there was. In fact this short story was never about two people. It was about her. About you, the reader. So I bring you full circle and take us back to the beginning, this story js incomplete; however, not by another book in the series or another chapter or another paragraph and not even by one sentence, rather just a word. A word which with only the reader could complete this story. So I ask you now.

“Sheza Shah, thank you for an amazing year and this is where everything started and we solidified our feelings for each other, that one night that we spent together and me asking you and just all the nostalgia. So baby, my love, my heart, my goose, my babboo, my everything. Will you be my valentines again?” Haider said.

Sheza replied, “…”
